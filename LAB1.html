<p>In this lab we will have an opportunity to do population modeling
using three different software packages: MS Excel, R, and InsightMaker.
I encourage you to work in groups- but just remember you must submit
your answers individually on WebCampus!</p>
<div id="nomenclature-for-population-ecology" class="section level2">
<h2>Nomenclature for Population Ecology</h2>
<p>First of all, we need a symbol to represent population size. This is
<span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>!</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\Delta N\)</span> represents the change
in population size, <span
class="math inline">\({N_{t+1}}-{N_t}\)</span></p>
<p>The famous “BIDE” equation is a way to break down <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta N\)</span> into components.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\Delta N = B + I - D - E \qquad
\text{(Eq. 1)}\)</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> represents the number of
births, <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> represents the number of
immigrants, <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> represents the number
of deaths, and <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> represents the
number of emigrants.</p>
<p>If we ignore immigration and emigration, then the BIDE equation
simplifies to:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\Delta N = B - D\)</span></p>
<p>Now let’s focus on <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span>. The important thing to recognize is
that the total number of births and deaths should get larger as the
population size gets larger. That is, <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span> are not <em>constant</em> - they change
as the population size <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> gets
bigger or smaller.</p>
<p>How can we re-express this statement in terms of more fundamental
properties of the population?</p>
<p>What about the <em>percent of the population that dies each year
(percent mortality)</em>? Or… the <em>number of births per female
(per-capita birth rate)</em>?</p>
<p>We will often call these quantities <strong>population vital
rates</strong> (or per-capita demographic rates). These quantities do
not necessarily change as the population size <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> gets bigger or smaller (at least in a
simple exponential growth model).</p>
<p>Examples of population vital rates:</p>
<ul>
<li>“<em>for every female in the population</em>, we expect 1.1
offspring will be born (birth, or fertility, rate)”</li>
<li>“<em>for every individual in the population today</em>, we expect
0.8 new one-year-olds to enter the population next year” (fecundity
rate)</li>
<li>“we expect 3% of the current population to be harvested this year”
(harvest rate)</li>
<li>“we expect 10% of the current population to die in the coming year”
(mortality rate)</li>
<li>“we expect 90% of the current population to survive in the coming
year” (survival rate)</li>
</ul>
<p>The population vital rates (per-capita demographic rates) are often
expressed as lower case letters. So <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> represents per-capita birth rate, and
<span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> represents fractional or
(per-capita) death rate (fraction of the population dying each
year).</p>
<p>To compute the per-capita birth rate <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, for example, we can divide the total
number of births (B) by the population size N:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(b = \frac {B_t}{N_t} \qquad \text{(Eq.
2)}\)</span></p>
<p>–or, re-factored in terms of B (total births)–</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(B_t = b \cdot N_t \qquad \text{(Eq.
3)}\)</span></p>
<p>The letter <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> represents time
(usually in years). So the above equation could be described as follows:
“the number of births in a given year is equal to the per-capita birth
rate times the total population size that year”</p>
<p>Similarly,</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(D_t = d \cdot N_t \qquad \text{(Eq.
4)}\)</span></p>
<p>Okay, we’re almost there.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(\Delta N = B - D \qquad \text{(Eq.
5)}\)</span></p>
<p>then</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\Delta N = b \cdot N_t - d \cdot
N_t\qquad \text{(Eq. 6)}\)</span></p>
<p>which is equal to:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\Delta N = (b - d) \cdot N_t \qquad
\text{(Eq. 7)}\)</span></p>
<p>which could also be written:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\Delta N = r \cdot N_t\qquad \text{(Eq.
8)}\)</span></p>
<p>Where <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> represents the
difference between the per-capita birth and death and death rates.</p>
<p>This is probably the most fundamental equation of population
ecology.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is positive, then births
are greater than deaths and the population grows.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(r&gt;0 \implies growing \space
population\)</span></p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is negative then deaths
exceed births and the population declines.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(r&lt;0 \implies declining \space
population\)</span></p>
<div id="continuous-population-growth" class="section level3">
<h3>Continuous population growth</h3>
<p>A continuously growing population is always growing over time- no
matter how small the time step, there is always some population growth
during that time period.</p>
<p>We can use <em>calculus notation</em> to consider the change in
population size for a continuously growing population:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial N}{\partial t} = r \cdot N
\qquad \text{(Eq. 9)}\)</span></p>
<p>If you <em>integrate</em> this equation over time from the initial
time (t=0) to time <em>t</em>, you get an equation that describes the
population size at any given time <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(N_t = N_0 e^{rt} \qquad \text{(Eq.
10)}\)</span></p>
<p>That is, population size at time <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is equal to the population size at time
zero (initial abundance, <span class="math inline">\(N_0\)</span>)
multiplied by the base of the natural logarithm (<em>e</em>) to the
<span class="math inline">\(rt\)</span> power.</p>
<p>There you have it! Now you can compute population growth and
population size over time for any population that is growing
<em>continuously</em>!</p>
<div id="doubling-time" class="section level4">
<h4>Doubling time</h4>
<p>One of the most intuitive ways to think about continuous exponential
growth is in terms of the <em>doubling time</em>- the time (usually in
years) it takes for a population to double in size.</p>
<p>Let’s compute the <em>doubling time</em> for a population with 7%
annual growth:</p>
<p>If you replace <span class="math inline">\(N_t\)</span> in the above
equation (eq. 10) with <span class="math inline">\(2*N_0\)</span>
(representing a doubling of the initial population size), replace <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> with 0.07 (representing 7% annual
growth), then you can solve for t. The result is that you get the
equation: <span class="math inline">\(t = \frac{ln(2)}{0.07}\)</span>.
Since the natural logarithm of 2 is 0.69, we can substitute 0.7 as a
close approximation. Since we tend to think best in percentages, we can
multiply by 100 (converting to percent) and we get <span
class="math inline">\(t = \frac{70}{7}\)</span>, which means this
population will double approximately every 10 years!</p>
<p>In general, if you want to compute the approximate doubling time of a
population, you can simply take the number 70 and divide by the annual
growth percentage: so if you have 7% annual growth per year, then to
compute doubling time just take the number 70, divide by the percent
rate of growth (here, 7%), and there you have it- the population will
double approximately every 10 years!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="discrete-population-growth" class="section level3">
<h3>Discrete population growth</h3>
<p>In a population with discrete growth, the population grows in spurts-
periods of no growth are interspersed with periods of rapid population
growth. Effectively, this results in a “stair-step” model, looking
something like this:</p>
<p><img src="LAB1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>You’ve probably seen the term “Lambda” (greek symbol <span
class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>) before to represent population
growth rate. Lambda is the “multiplicative growth rate”, also known as
the <em>finite rate of growth</em> of a population.</p>
<p>Lambda is what you multiply current abundance by to compute abundance
in the next time step. It itself can be computed using the formula <span
class="math inline">\(\frac {N_{t+1}}{N_t}\)</span></p>
<p>Since Lambda is what we use to “bump” population size up from what it
is this year to what it will be next year, Lambda is a representation of
<em>discrete population growth</em> (it implicitly represents a
“stair-step” model of population growth.</p>
<p>We can derive Lambda using the following logic:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(N_{t+1}=N_t + B - D \qquad \text{(Eq.
11)}\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(N_{t+1}=N_t + b_d \cdot N_t - d_d \cdot
N_t \qquad \text{(Eq. 12)}\)</span></p>
<p>I am using the <em>d</em> subscript to indicate that the per-capita
birth and death rates now represent <strong>discrete growth</strong>
(births and deaths only occur once in each time step)</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(N_{t+1}=N_t + (b_d - d_d) \cdot N_t
\qquad \text{(Eq. 13)}\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(N_{t+1}=N_t + r_d \cdot N_t \qquad
\text{(Eq. 14)}\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(N_{t+1}=N_t \cdot (1 + r_d) \qquad
\text{(Eq. 15)}\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(N_{t+1}=\lambda \cdot N_t \qquad
\text{(Eq. 16)}\)</span></p>
<p>A Lambda above 1 implies that births exceed deaths each year, and the
population is growing:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\lambda&gt;1 \implies growing \space
population\)</span></p>
<p>And…</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\lambda&lt;1 \implies growing \space
population\)</span></p>
<p>Finally, if you want to compute the population size after <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span> time-steps of discrete population
growth (analogous to eq. 10) you can use the following equation:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(N_t = N_0 * \lambda^{t} \qquad \text{(Eq.

<h3>Difference between discrete and continuous growth</h3>
<p>It can be difficult to conceptualize the difference between discrete
and continuous growth.</p>
<p>Here are some expressions to illustrate the difference between
discrete and continuous population vital rates:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(b=0.9\)</span>: “New individuals enter
into the population at a rate of 0.9 per female per year, and these new
individuals are born continuously throughout the year”<br />
<span class="math inline">\(b_d=0.9\)</span>: “Babies enter the
population at a per-capita rate of 0.9 per female per year, but
individuals only give birth once each spring”<br />
<span class="math inline">\(d=0.23\)</span>: “Approximately 23% of the
population dies each year, but the deaths occur evenly throughout the
year”<br />
<span class="math inline">\(d_d=0.23\)</span>: “Approximately 23% of the
population dies each year, but nearly all the deaths are assumed to
occur during winter hibernation”<br />
<span class="math inline">\(r=0.15\)</span>: “The population is growing
constantly (continuously) at a rate of exactly 15% per year” NOTE: you
will not have exactly 15% more individuals in the population one year
later, but in fact you will have 16.2% more individuals due to the
process of <em>compounding</em> (because the population keeps growing
even within each year- the population doesn’t just remain at it’s
initial size all year long)! This should be more clear by the end of
this lab.<br />
<span class="math inline">\(r_d=0.15\)</span>: “The population size one
year from now will be exactly 15% higher than it is today”</p>
<p>For a continuously growing population, you can convert seamlessly
between the population growth multiplier Lambda (<span
class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>) and the continuous rate of
growth (<em>r</em>) easily: all you need to do is use the natural
logarithm:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(e^r = \lambda\)</span><br />
<span class="math inline">\(r = ln(\lambda)\)</span></p>
<p>For a discrete-growth population, the conversion is slightly
different:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(1+r_d= \lambda\)</span> <span
class="math inline">\(r_d = \lambda-1\)</span></p>
<p><strong>Q</strong> What is lambda for a population that growing at a
<em>discrete</em> rate of 7% per year?</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong> What is lambda for a population that growing
<em>continuously</em> at a rate of 7% per year?</p>
<p>Okay let’s start the lab! The first software we will use is our old
friend, Microsoft <strong>Excel</strong>! (or Google Sheets, or your
preferred spreadsheet software!)</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="exponential-growth-in-excel" class="section level2">
<h2>Exponential growth in Excel</h2>
<p>We will start with an in-class demonstration:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Open the Excel spreadsheet <a
href="ExpGrowthExcel.xlsx">ExpGrowthExcel.xlsx</a>. To download this
file, right click on the link and select “<em>Save link as..</em>”. In
the first column, we have a time step of 1 year for 30 years. In the
second column, we have an initial population size (<span
class="math inline">\(N_0\)</span>) of 100 individuals. We also have a
per-capita rate of increase (<span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>)
that is currently set at 0.1 (10%) per year. Assume for now that <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> represents <span
class="math inline">\(r_d\)</span>, or the <em>discrete rate of
increase</em>. That is: the population size next year will be exactly
10% larger than the population this year.</p></li>
<li><p>To generate <span class="math inline">\(N_t\)</span> for the
remaining time steps, we need to apply our knowledge of population
ecology. Specifically we need to apply equation 16, above for modeling
discrete population growth in a single time step. You will first want to
convert <span class="math inline">\(r_d\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> using the formula <span
class="math inline">\(\lambda = 1+r_d\)</span>. Do this by clicking in a
cell (e.g., cell D5), typing ‘=’ in the cell (indicating that you are
about to enter a <strong>formula</strong>), clicking on cell D3
(indicating that you will use this cell’s value in the formula) and
adding 1. As you do this, you should see the equation you are creating
appear in the equation editor. The formula should look like
<code>=D3+1</code>. Next, you can apply equation 16 directly by clicking
in the empty <span class="math inline">\(N_{1}\)</span> cell (position
B3), typing <code>=</code> in the cell (indicating that you are about to
enter a <strong>formula</strong>), clicking on the <span
class="math inline">\(N_{0}\)</span> cell (position B2– indicating that
you will use this cell’s value in the formula), and completing the
equation (e.g., <code>=B2*D5</code>, where cell D5 stores <span
class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>). Hit enter.</p></li>
<li><p>You can fill the remainder of the cells using the same equation
for the other time steps by clicking and dragging (or double clicking)
the small square at the bottom of the N(2) cell, which appears when the
cell is selected.</p></li>
<li><p>What happened? We are not seeing a growing population here-
actually it seems quite flat! this is surely not what we want! Click on
the N(3) cell to see what equation is being used to calculate the cell
value. The equation is <code>=B3*D6</code>. The B3 part is correct - we
want to calculate the N(3) population size using the <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> from the previous timestep - but the D6
part is incorrect. We always want to use the same <span
class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> - which is always in the same
cell (cell D5). You can see that when you drag down an equation as we
have done, Excel adds 1 for each row so that the equation references the
same <em>relative</em> positions in the spreadsheet for each new cell
you want to calculate. We like that Excel did that for <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span>, but not for <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>, so we can tell Excel to keep
this value in the same row (row 3) for <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> (or <span
class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>) by inserting a dollar sign in
our equation (in Excel terminology, this is called a ‘fixed
reference’).</p></li>
<li><p>In the N(2) cell, edit the equation in the equation editor (or
‘function bar’) above the spreadsheet so that there is a dollar sign in
D3 (i.e., <code>D$3</code> instead of <code>D3</code>) (or just use the
F4 shortcut).</p></li>
<li><p>Now drag the equation down again, and you should have a
population size in row 32 of 1745 (representing the population size at
year 30!).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>NOTE: you can format the cells in column B to be whole numbers using
the context menu (select column B &gt;&gt; Format Cells &gt;&gt; Number
&gt;&gt; Decimal places = 0)</p>
<ol start="7" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Now we will plot our population against time. Select both columns of
data, and select the <em>scatter plot</em> (or “line plot”) option under
the ‘Insert’ menu. A plot of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> by
Time will automatically appear. You can change the <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> value, the data and chart will
automatically adjust.</li>
</ol>
<div id="exercise-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Exercise 1</h3>
<p>Please provide short answers to the following questions on WebCampus
(you will be asked to <strong>provide your Excel
spreadsheet</strong>).</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>Short answer (1a.)</em></strong> [numeric response]
Change the per-capita growth rate to 0.07 in cell D3. Based on what we
did together in the demo, this should change the value of abundance in
year 30 (cell B32) automatically. <em>What is the new final abundance at
year 30?</em> assuming discrete annual population growth?</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Short answer (1b.)</em></strong> [numeric AND short
text response] Assuming that the per-capita rate of growth <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> in this model represents
<em>continuous</em> and not <em>discrete</em> growth, apply equation 10
(continuous-growth model- see above) to compute the expected population
size in year 30. <em>What is the new final abundance at year 30,
assuming continuous growth?</em>. Is this new value different from your
answer in question 1a (discrete growth model)? If so, did the continuous
model produce a larger or smaller population estimate (for year 30) than
the discrete growth model?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>HINT: computing abundance at year 30 in the continuous-time model can
be performed as a <em>single calculation</em> (using eq. 10, above)-
don’t over-think this one. You may use a scientific calculator instead
of Excel if you’d like.</p>
<p>HINT: use the EXP function in Excel to raise <em>e</em> (the base of
the natural logarithm) to any power: for example, to compute <span
class="math inline">\(e^{0.07}\)</span> you type “=EXP(0.07)” in
Excel.</p>
<p>In general, if you don’t know the syntax for a function in Excel,
click on the button labeled “fx” and you can search for functions using
search terms!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Short answer (1c.)</em></strong> [short text response]
What are the <em>units</em> of the per-capita population growth rate
<span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> (also known as “intrinsic rate of
growth”)?</li>
</ul>
<p>HINT: The answer is in the Gotelli book. Note that abundance N is in
units of <em>individuals</em>. Time is generally represented in units of
<em>years</em> in wildlife population models.</p>
<p>NOTE: The answer is the same for discrete and continuous-growth
models.</p>
<p>For the following problem (1d.) we will again assume discrete
population growth (i.e., the “stair-step” model where the population
grows in bursts), but this time we will assume the growth occurs in
half-years instead of whole years (semi-annual growth). To do this, you
will first need to divide the annual per-capita growth rate in half: so,
if the annual growth rate is 0.07 (7% growth), the semi-annual growth
rate would be 0.035 (3.5% percent growth each 6 months). Also, you need
to change your number of time steps to 60 (60 half-years is equal to 30
whole-years). Try it in Excel!</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>Short answer (1d.)</em></strong> [numeric and short
text responses] What is the final abundance after 30 years (60
half-years) assuming semi-annual discrete growth of 3.5% per half-year
(which implies 7% annual growth, just like your previous calculations
assumed) (see more detailed instructions above)? Is this value different
from your answer in question 1a (annual discrete growth of 7% per year)?
If so, is your new estimate (semi-annual discrete growth) larger or
smaller than your answer for question 1a (annual discrete
growth)?</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Short answer (1e.)</em></strong> [numeric and short
text responses] Assuming a <em>continuously growing population</em> with
a 3.5% semi-annual rate of growth (equivalent to a 7% continuous annual
rate of growth, like question 1b), apply equation 10 (continuous-growth
model) to compute the expected population size at time step 60 (60
half-years = 30 full years, equivalent to question 1b). <em>What is the
new final abundance estimate at year 30 (60 half-years), assuming
continuous 3.5% semi-annual growth?</em>. Is this value different from
your answer in question 1b (continuous annual growth)? If so, is your
new estimate larger or smaller than your answer from q1b?</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Short answer (1f.)</em></strong> [short text
response] Imagine you modeled this population using a <em>discrete
monthly</em> growth model instead of a discrete annual model (like q1a).
Based on your above results (q1a-e), do you think the resulting estimate
of population size after 30 years (360 months, using a monthly growth
rate of 7/12 = 0.583% monthly growth rate, which is equivalent to a 7%
annual growth rate) would be closer to the continuous-time estimate
(answer to 1b) than your answer from 1a (discrete annual growth) and 1d
(discrete semi-annual growth)? Feel free to test this using Excel (and
explain how you did this), or use your intuition and explain your
rationale?</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Short answer (1g.)</em></strong> [short text
response] Can you think of at least one real-world example where
continuous growth (eq. 10) would be a more biologically realistic model
than discrete growth (eq. 16)? Justify your answer.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Short answer (1h.)</em></strong> [short text
response] Can you think of at least one real-world example where
discrete population growth (eq. 16) would be a more biologically
realistic model than continuous growth (eq. 10)? Justify your
answer.</p></li>

</div>
<div id="set-up-the-workspaceenvironment" class="section level3">
<h3>Set up the workspace/environment</h3>
<p>The first thing we usually do when we start an R session is:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Open an new or existing RStudio Project</li>
<li>Open a new or existing <strong>script</strong></li>
<li>In the script, define key variables and functions, and load any
additional <strong>packages</strong> (extensions) into our environment
(or workspace). When you write code, always type in the “script” window
in Rstudio. You can execute commands using command-enter or
control-enter in Rstudio.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this lab, setting up the workspace is easy. We don’t need to load
any packages or define any new functions. We just need to define our
parameter of interest - <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> -, and
set up a <strong>storage vector</strong> to store population abundance
over time.</p>
<p>We can store data in memory by assigning it to an “object” using the
assignment operator <strong>&lt;-</strong>. For example, this would
assign the object “x” the value of 5.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>x &lt;- 5     # define the variable &#39;x&#39; as representing the value 5
x          # Print the value stored in the object &quot;x&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Note that any text after a pound sign (#) is not evaluated by R.
These are <em>comments</em> and are intended to help you follow the
code. You should always include comments in any code that you write- we
humans tend to read and understand written language better than computer
code!</p>
<p>Let’s assign our per-capita population growth rate, <span
class="math inline">\(r_d\)</span> (discrete annual rate of growth-
let’s call it <code>r_d</code> in R), and our initial population size to
an object called <strong>N0</strong> (that is, population size at time
0), and the number of years to simulate.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>r_d &lt;- 0.1     #Assign the value of 0.1 to the object &quot;r_d&quot;, or discrete per-capita growth rate (discrete)
lambda &lt;- 1 + r_d           # (1 + r) is equal to lambda, the finite rate of growth.  This stores the result of the calculation (1 + 0.1 = 1.1) in the object &quot;lambda&quot;.
N0 &lt;- 100    #Assign the value of 100 to the object &quot;N0&quot;, or initial population size
nyears &lt;- 30 #Assign the value of 30 to the object &quot;nyears&quot;, or the number of time steps to simulate</code></pre>
<p>If we want to know what the population size is at the next time step,
we can simply multiply N0 by lambda.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>N0 * lambda   #Multiplies the value stored in the object &quot;N0&quot; by lambda. As soon as you run this line of code, the result of the calculation is printed.</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 110</code></pre>
<p>How can we find the population size for the next 30 years? Let’s
first make an object that is a vector of years using the
<strong>seq()</strong> or “sequence” function.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>year &lt;- seq(from=0, to=nyears, by=1)   #Creates a sequence of numbers from 0 to the value stored in the object &quot;nyears&quot; (in this case, 30). Because you&#39;ve told this sequence to increment by 1, you&#39;ve created a string of numbers from 0 - 50 that contains 31 elements. A single series of elements (e.g., a single column of numbers) is called a vector. You then assign this vector to the object &quot;years&quot;.

year                                   #Print the value of the object &quot;year&quot; that you just created.</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  [1]  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24
## [26] 25 26 27 28 29 30</code></pre>
<p>Now, let’s build a storage structure to store simulated population
size over this time period</p>
<pre class="r"><code>vec_size &lt;- nyears+1  # number of values to store is one more than nyears (includes year 0 all the way to year 50)
N &lt;- numeric(vec_size)    #Make an empty storage vector. The numeric() function takes the contents within the parentheses and converts those contents to the &quot;numeric&quot; class. Don&#39;t worry if this doesn&#39;t make sense -- what you need to know is that the value within the parentheses (in this case 31) is used to tell this function how many zeros to create. So, this line of code creates a vector of 31 zeros, and assigns that vector to the object &quot;N&quot;.

names(N) &lt;- year

N                         #Prints the contents of the object &quot;N&quot;.</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25

<div id="run-the-simulation" class="section level3">
<h3>Run the simulation!</h3>
<p>Then we can use a <strong>for loop</strong> (a very powerful computer
programming technique) to automatically generate the population size for

<pre class="r"><code>N[1] &lt;- N0                # The brackets [] are used to indicate the position of an element within a vector.

for (i in 2:(nyears+1)){  # This for-loop will run through the line of code between the curly brackets {}. &quot;i&quot; is simply the name of a variable (you can use &quot;j&quot;, or &quot;k&quot;, instead -- any variable name will do). &quot;i&quot; changes each time the loop iterates; basically, it will increase by 1 each time the loop is run, starting at &quot;2&quot; up until the specified maximum number of loops &quot;nyears+1&quot;.

class="math inline">\(r_d\)</span>) using Eq. 17. Use scratch paper (or
virtual scratch pad) to make your calculations (showing all your work as
clearly as possible), take a photo (or screenshot) and upload the image
in WebCampus.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Short answer (2g.)</em></strong> [numeric response]
Change the value of <span class="math inline">\(r_d\)</span> to -0.07
(7% discrete annual population <em>decline</em>). How long until the
population goes extinct? NOTE: we will define extinction in this
exercise as &lt;1 individual in the population- a fraction of an
individual is not much of a population!</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Short answer (2h.)</em></strong> [short text
response] In 2g above, we defined extinction as &lt;1 individual in the
population. Propose one alternative definition of extinction and justify
why your definition might make more sense than the definition used in 2g
(feel free to use a real-world example).</p></li>

<h2>Exponential growth in InsightMaker</h2>
<p>You should already have created a free account in <a

already know the basics about how to set up and run a model from
previous class meetings.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Click “Create New Insight” to start a new model (click “Clear
this Demo” to clear the canvas and have an open workspace). Save the
blank model by clicking the “Save” button.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a new [Stock] named <em>Population</em> using the
“<strong>Add Primitive</strong>” button at top left (“Primitive” is just
a computer-sciencey term referring to basic building blocks of a
computer programming language). You can name the [Stock] and configure
it in the properties tab at the right. Make sure you set the [Stock] so
that negative values are NOT allowed.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><img src="IM1.png" /></p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Change the Initial Value of <em>Population</em> to 100.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a new [Flow] going from empty space to the primitive
<em>Population</em> (make sure the <strong>Flow/Transitions</strong>
button is activated instead of <strong>Links</strong> at the top, hover
over <em>Population</em> until an arrow appears, click and drag to
create the [Flow], use the <strong>Reverse Connection Direction</strong>
button to change the flow direction). Name the flow
<em>Births</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a new [Flow] going from <em>Population</em> to empty
space. Name the flow <em>Deaths</em>.</p></li>

<ol start="7" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Change the <strong>Flow Rate</strong> property of <em>Births</em>

<li><p>Change the <strong>Flow Rate</strong> property of <em>Deaths</em>

<h3>Exercise 3 (InsightMaker problems)</h3>
<p>Please provide short answers to the following questions, and (when
prompted) <strong>provide InsightMaker links to back up your
answers</strong>.</p>
<p>First, modify the above model so that per-capita (discrete) birth
rate and death rate are separate elements of the model (create 2 new
“Variables” in InsightMaker). Your Insight should now look something
like this:</p>
<p><img src="IM3.png" /></p>
<p>To enable easy manipulation of these variables, change the
<strong>Show Value Slider</strong> options for <em>Birth Rate</em> and
<em>Death Rate</em> (in the properties windows for these variables) to
‘Yes’. For both of these two variables, change the <strong>Slider Max
value</strong> to 1, the <strong>Slider Min value</strong> to 0, and the
<strong>Slider Step value</strong> to 0.01. For <em>Population</em>, set
the <strong>Show Value Slider</strong> option to ‘Yes’; for this slider
(this value represents initial abundance <span
class="math inline">\(N_0\)</span>), set the maximum slider value to
1000 and set the slider step size to 1 so we don’t have fractional
individuals!</p>
<p>Now click on the white space of your model; you should now see the
Birth Rate, Population and Death Rate sliders on the info tab. Change
the slider values of the rates a few times, re-running the simulation
each time. When you are confident that your model is working right,
share it with your instructor and TA (save as a “public insight” and
insert the URL in the appropriate place in WebCampus).</p>
<p><strong>Clone</strong> your previous Insight before you move on to
the next problem (otherwise any changes you make will carry over to your
answer to the previous problem!). The “Clone Insight” link is located in
the upper right corner. <em>Always clone your Insights</em> after you
have copied a link to an insight into your lab write-up. That way, you
won’t inadvertently change a model before your instructors have a chance
to verify you did everything right!</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>Short answer (3a.)</em></strong> [Text input:
InsightMaker URL] Submit the link for your InsightMaker model
here.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Short answer (3b.)</em></strong> [Short text input]
Starting with a growing population (where birth rate exceeds death
rate), can you come up with two different scenarios in which
<em>Population</em> is neither growing nor declining, by only changing
one of the sliders from the starting conditions (ie, starting with the
version you just submitted in 3a)? Explain your answer.</p></li>
