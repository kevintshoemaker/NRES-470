### Course description  
This class will explore how concepts of population ecology can be used to inform the conservation and management of natural populations and ecosystems. We will emphasize practical approaches to problem-solving in ecology, conservation, and wildlife management using simulation models and statistics. Topics will include population viability analysis (PVA), habitat suitability models, metapopulation models, competition and predation models, threats to population viability, wildlife population management and more. Laboratory exercises will provide students with hands-on experience with population models and their practical applications in the conservation and management of wild populations.

### Prerequisites    
- BIOL 314 or NRES 217 (Ecology)  
- NRES 310 (Wildlife Ecology and Management)  

### Texts  
- [Gotelli, N. J. A primer of ecology](https://www.amazon.com/Primer-Ecology-Fourth-Nicholas-Gotelli/dp/0878933182)      
- optional: [Beyond Connecting the Dots](http://beyondconnectingthedots.com/) (free download)   
- Additional readings from the primary literature will be assigned for discussion periodically.    

### Software   
- [InsightMaker- free web-based systems modeling tool](https://insightmaker.com/)(no installation needed)        
- [R- free statistical programming language](https://cran.r-project.org/)      
- MS Excel (hopefully you already have this or equivalent spreadsheet software on your laptop!)

### Student Learning outcomes
SLO 1.	Identify the major classes of models used by ecologists (e.g., statistical vs mechanistic, quantitative vs heuristic, stochastic vs deterministic) and explain how and why ecologists use these models.    
SLO 2.	Apply tools such as population viability analysis (PVA) and metapopulation models to address the conservation and management of natural populations.   
SLO 3.	Perform basic statistics, data visualization, simulation modeling and model validation with Excel, the statistical computing language 'R', and the web-based software, InsightMaker.    
SLO 4.	Critically evaluate the strength of inferences drawn from ecological simulation models using tools such as sensitivity analysis.    
SLO 5.	Explain how species interactions can influence population dynamics (e.g., predictions of species range shifts).     
SLO 6.	Communicate original research in applied population and community ecology via professional-style oral and written presentations.   

### Grading: 
The course grade will be based on the following components:

Lab exercises (7 total)	         20%  (70 points)     
Quizzes and participation        10%  (40 points)     
Group project                    25%  (100 points)      
Midterm exam # 1 (date TBD)	     10%  (40 points)    
Midterm exam # 2 (date TBD)   	 10%  (40 points)    
Final exam (5/8/2020)   	       25%  (100 points)    

NOTE: Graduate students enrolled in NRES 670 will have an additional 50 pts used to calculate their grade (see below) of a total of 370 points.     
Grading scale: A (100 to 93), A- (92 to 90), B+ (89 to 87), B (86 to 83), B- (82 to 80), C+ (79 to 77), C (76 to 73), C- (72 to 70), D+ (69 to 67), D (66 to 63), D- (62 to 60), F (below 60). 

### Exams:
There will be two midterm exams and a final exam, all of which will be cumulative, covering all course material covered up to the week prior to the exam. These will consist of multiple-choice, short-answer questions, and essay questions requiring synthesis of ideas and critical thinking. The midterm and final exams will be cumulative, and based on all information presented up through the week prior to the exam.

### Lectures
Lecture grades will be based primarily on participation and short quizzes. Participation is essential to the learning process (and to our mutual enjoyment of this class). Learning is not a passive process; students are expected to engage with the material in class rather than simply listen and take notes. You should be prepared in class to ask questions, to answer questions, and to engage in problem-solving activities.   

### Labs  
Lab exercises will focus on applying concepts and methods introduced in lectures, and will involve real-world problems in wildlife conservation and management wherever possible. Graded lab assignments will involve figures, tables, InsightMaker models and R code (when applicable) and responses to questions in short-answer format.  

### Final group project 
Students will work in groups of ~4 to perform a population viability analysis (PVA) to rank conservation or management actions for a species of conservation concern (species of your choice!). Grading will be based on finished products (written and oral presentations) as well as participation and peer evaluations. 

### Graduate credit (for students enrolled in NRES 670) 
Graduate students will be subject to additional expectations in order to receive graduate credit for this course. In particular, graduate students will be expected to develop an original lecture and lead an original lab activity related to their lecture. Graduate students will also be expected to achieve a deeper understanding of the course material, and therefore will be assigned additional readings from the scientific literature and will be expected to participate as leaders in discussions and lab activities.

### Make-up policy and late work:
Missed exams and labs cannot be made up, except in the case of emergencies. If you miss a class meeting, it is your responsibility to talk to one of your classmates about what you missed. If you miss a lab meeting, you are still responsible for completing the lab activities and write-up on your own time. Whenever possible, please let me know in advance if you are going to miss class or lab.
