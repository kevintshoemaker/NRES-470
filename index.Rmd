### Course description  
This class explores how concepts of population ecology can be used to inform the conservation and management of natural populations and ecosystems. We emphasize practical approaches to problem-solving in ecology, conservation, and wildlife management using simulation models and inferential statistics. Topics include Population Viability Analysis (PVA), limits to population growth, metapopulation ecology, species interactions (competition and predation), threats to wild populations, wildlife management and more. Laboratory exercises provide students with hands-on experience with wildlife population models and their practical applications in wildlife ecology and management.

### Prerequisites    
- BIOL 314 or NRES 217 (Ecology)  
- NRES 310 (Wildlife Ecology and Management)  
NOTE: this course is a prerequisite for NRES 488 (Dynamics and Management of Wildlife Populations) and is designed to complement NRES 421 (Conservation Biology).

### Texts  
- [Gotelli, N. J. A primer of ecology](https://www.amazon.com/Primer-Ecology-Fourth-Nicholas-Gotelli/dp/0878933182)      
- Additional readings will be assigned for discussion periodically.    

### Software   
- [InsightMaker- web-based systems modeling tool](https://insightmaker.com/)(free, web-based, need account)

- Spreadsheet software (MS Excel, Google Sheets or equivalent)
- Top Hat (interactive classroom software- invitations should have been emailed to you)

### Student Learning outcomes
SLO 1.	Explain how and why simulation models are used by ecologists and wildlife professionals.    
SLO 2.	Apply tools such as population viability analysis (PVA) and metapopulation models to address the conservation and management of wild populations.   
SLO 3.	Perform basic statistics, data visualization, simulation modeling and model validation with Excel, the statistical computing language 'R', and the web-based software, InsightMaker.    
SLO 4.	Critically evaluate the strength of inferences drawn from ecological simulation models using tools such as sensitivity analysis.    
SLO 5.	Explain how species interactions can influence population dynamics (e.g., predictions of species range shifts).     
SLO 6.	Communicate original research in applied population and community ecology via professional-style oral and written presentations.   

### Grading: 
The course grade will be based on the following components:

Lab exercises (7 total)	         20%     
Lectures/participation           10%     
Group project                    30%      
Midterm exam # 1 (date TBD)	     10%    
Midterm exam # 2 (date TBD)   	 10%     
Final exam              	       20%     

Grading scale: A (100 to 93), A- (92 to 90), B+ (89 to 87), B (86 to 83), B- (82 to 80), C+ (79 to 77), C (76 to 73), C- (72 to 70), D+ (69 to 67), D (66 to 63), D- (62 to 60), F (below 60). 

### Exams:
There will be two midterm exams and a final exam, all of which will be cumulative, covering all course material covered up to the week prior to the exam. These will consist of multiple-choice, short-answer questions, and essay questions requiring synthesis of key concepts.

### Lectures
Lecture grades will be based primarily on participation and short in-class quizzes (via TopHat). Participation is essential to the learning process (and to our mutual enjoyment of this class). Learning is not a passive process; students are expected to engage with the material in class rather than simply listen and take notes. You should be prepared in class to ask questions, to answer questions, and to engage in problem-solving activities.   

### Labs  
Lab exercises will focus on applying concepts and methods introduced in lectures, and will involve real-world problems in wildlife conservation and management wherever possible. Graded lab assignments will involve figures, tables, InsightMaker models and R code (when applicable) and responses to questions in short-answer format.  

### Final group project 
Students will work in groups of 3-4 to perform a population viability analysis (PVA) to rank conservation or management actions for a species of conservation concern (species of your choice!). Grading will be based on finished products (written and oral presentations) as well as participation and peer evaluations. 

### Graduate credit (for students enrolled in NRES 670) 
Graduate students will be subject to additional expectations in order to receive graduate credit for this course. In particular, graduate students will be expected to develop an original lecture and lead an original lab activity related to a topic relevant to wildlife population ecology. Graduate students will also be expected to achieve a deeper understanding of the course material, and therefore will be expected to participate as leaders in discussions and lab activities.

### Make-up policy and late work:
Missed exams and labs cannot be made up, except in the case of emergencies. If you miss a class meeting, it is your responsibility to talk to one of your classmates about what you missed. If you miss a lab meeting, you are still responsible for completing the lab activities and write-up. Let me or your TA know in advance if you are going to miss class or lab.

### Top Hat
We will be using the [Top Hat](https://tophat.com/) interactive learning platform in class. You will be able to submit answers to in-class questions using Apple or Android smartphones and tablets, laptops, or through text message.   

Top Hat is free of charge for UNR students this year! You should all have received an invitation via email. You can also enroll using the join code 632462.
