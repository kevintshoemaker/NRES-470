<h1>Detailed parameterization: a metapopulation model of prairie dogs

<p>Here I will take you through a detailed parameterization of the
prairie dog and ferret models (see the paper <a

<p>This model is more complex than the models you will be doing for your
final project, but hopefully it serves as a useful illustration of how
you can justify your decisions about how to build and parameterize your
models.</p>

<h3>Spatial structure of study region</h3>
<div class="figure">
<img src="pdog_studyregion1.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Figure 2: study region</p>
</div>
<p>The spatial structure of the metapopulation was based on the
distribution of prairie dogs in the <em>Conata Basin</em>, a subset of
71 prairie dog populations within the Conata/Badlands region in South
Dakota and covering ca. 500 km2 (Fig. 2; delineated based on Biggins et
al. 2011) is a portion of the Buffalo Gap National Grasslands directly
south of Badlands National Park and is administered by the US Forest
Service (Fig. 2). This area was chosen in the early 1990’s for
reintroduction of black-footed ferrets due to the extensive network of
high-density prairie dog colonies located on public lands (Livieri
2006).</p>
<p>Prairie dog colonies in Conata Basin, Badlands National Park, and
Buffalo Gap National Grasslands in southwestern South Dakota, USA
(hereafter, Conata/Badlands region) were <em>mapped biennially by the US
Forest Service</em> from 1996-2009 using differentially corrected Global
Positioning Systems (GPS) units to connect the outermost prairie dog
burrows into a polygon (Biggins et al. 2006a).</p>
<p>Prairie dog colonies in the surrounding areas were mapped in 2004
using aerial transects and digital imaging (Sidle et al. 2001, Cooper
and Gabriel 2005). We converted prairie dog colony maps to binary
(0=non-habitat, 1=habitat) raster maps with 50m cell size. We re-imposed
barriers (e.g., roads, pipelines) that were lost in the rasterization
process.</p>
<p>We used the union of all years to define potential habitat. We used
neighborhood distance of 1 cell (50m) to define the population structure
(see Akçakaya 2002 for details of how RAMAS GIS determines spatial
structure). Thus, we assumed each colony is a distinct biological
population, which may be connected to other such populations (see
section on dispersal below). Excluding very small colonies with carrying
capacity (K) &lt;100 (see below), this resulted in 1591 PD populations
ranging from about 5 ha to 10,000 ha, with a median size of 16 ha and
covering ca. 20,000 km2 (Fig. 3).</p>

<div id="carrying-capacity-and-density-dependence"
class="section level3">
<h3>Carrying capacity and density-dependence</h3>
<p>Reproduction in prairie dogs is often limited by resources (Hoogland
2001), suggesting a Ricker-type (scramble) density-dependent effect on
fecundities. We therefore used this type of density dependence, and
estimated the maximum growth rate (<span
class="math inline">\(R_{max}\)</span>) based on the average of
exponential growth rates exhibited by several populations following
crashes. Three of these rates were following crashes due to plague:
1.466 (Biggins et al. 2006a, Fig 6.4), 2.024 (Cully and Williams 2001,
Fig 4, years 1989-1991) and 3.806 (Cully and Williams 2001, Fig 4, years
1995-1997). We combined these rates with four growth rates following
crashes due to other causes, including shooting, toxicants and removal
and translocation (Reeve and Vosburgh 2006, Table 10-3, excluding the
lowest and highest rates, which were from populations that had not
undergone a recent population reduction). The average of these 7
exponential growth rates was 2.44. For sensitivity analysis, we used the
quartiles, giving a range of 1.8 to 2.8. These values coincided with an
independent estimate based on the intercept of the regression of
population growth rate (<span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>) on
population size (<span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>) from the data
of Hoogland (1995, Table 16.1), which gave us estimates of 2.4 to 3.7,
depending on the type of regression. Given that regression of R on N
often overestimates <span class="math inline">\(R_{max}\)</span>, this
range is consistent with the estimate based on exponential growth phases
of the two populations mentioned above.</p>
<p>We assumed each mapped colony (see above) represented a distinct
biological population, with carrying capacity (K) defined as a function
of colony area and average densities of prairie dogs. At Conata Basin,
the average density of prairie dogs prior to the arrival of plague was
28.7/ha (Livieri 2006). Thus, we multiplied the number of cells in each
patch with 7.175 (=28.7x0.25) to calculate the carrying capacity of that
patch (because under the Ricker-type density dependence we used, average
abundance would approximately equal the equilibrium abundance or
carrying capacity). Colonies with K&lt;100 were excluded from analysis,
to decrease the number of populations and because very small populations
do not contribute substantially to population dynamics. We assumed
initial abundances were equal to K for each population, and we ran a
10-year burn-in period for all simulations to ensure that all colonies
were at equilibrium with their environment and had reached a <em>stable
age distribution</em> (S.A.D.).</p>

<h3>Demographic structure and vital rates</h3>
<p>We developed an age- and sex-structured matrix model for prairie dogs
using RAMAS Metapop software (v. 6.0; Akçakaya and Root 2013), with
eight female and six male age classes, parameterized using survival
rates and fecundities drawn from Hoogland (2001). We parameterized the
matrix according to a pre-breeding census. We used survival rates based
on Hoogland (2001, Figs. 1a and 2a), and fitted a polynomial regression
of survival rate vs. age for each sex to obtain a smooth function of age
(Fig. 4). We calculated litter size as 3.1 (from Hoogland 2001, figure
3a). Combining this value with proportion of females breeding (0.43;
Hoogland 2001), and survival rate of zero-year olds, we estimated
fecundity as 0.418 daughters and 0.379 sons per adult female (age 2+)
and 0.209 daughters and 0.189 sons per yearling female (age 1). We
assumed polygynous mating system with each male mating with up to 4
females. Because the density dependence function modifies the stage
matrix as a function of population size, the model results would be
sensitive to the <span class="math inline">\(R_{max}\)</span> value of
the density-dependence function, not to the exact vales of survival
rates and fecundities. Therefore, the sensitivity to vital rates was
modeled through the <span class="math inline">\(R_{max}\)</span>
sensitivity (see section on sensitivity analysis, below). All colonies
were initialized at <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> and at stable
age distribution, and all simulations were run with a 10 year burn-in
period (to reach approximate equilibrium in the prairie dog
metapopulation).</p>

<h3>Variability</h3>
<p>The temporal variation in vital rates is based on 14 years of age and
sex-specific census data from Hoogland (1995, Table 16.1, page 377). It
is important to note that the censused population has fluctuated between
150 and 250 individuals and does not seem to have crashed because of
plague or other reasons during the study period (otherwise, adding
disease dynamics would overestimate variability). In order to obtain
environmental variability, we removed demographic variance from observed
variance of survival rates and fecundities, based on expected binomial
and Poisson variance (Akçakaya 2002), and calculated coefficients of
variation (Table A1-1). For sensitivity analysis, we used minimum and
maximum values based on bootstrapping (Table A1-1).</p>

<div id="plague" class="section level3">
<h3>Plague</h3>
<p>We modeled plague dynamics within the prairie dog metapopulation as
catastrophes spread by dispersers, with virulence (overall survival) and
per-disperser probability of initiating an outbreak estimated from the
Outbreak epidemiological model described below (n = 1000 replicates). We
calculated the probability that a disperser initiates a catastrophe in
the target population by multiplying the year-averaged probability that
an individual (in a population that is experiencing an outbreak) is in
disease state E (infected but not yet infectious), with the probability
that a single individual in disease state E initiates an plague
epizootic that kills at least half of the population. Specifically, the
OUTBREAK model indicated a 9.3% chance of an individual disperser being
capable of initiating plague in a new colony (averaged over an entire
year, a prairie dog capable of dispersal from an infected colony had a
9.3% chance of being an exposed carrier), and a 97% chance that such a
disperer would initiate a catastrophe, resulting in a 9% per-disperser
chance of initiating a catastrophe. When a catastrophe does get
initiated in a population, the survival rate is determined, according to
the Outbreak results, as 2.9% survival (97.1% mortality) in the year
that plague is initiated (with no long-term effects). We initiated the
plague outbreak in year 11, following a 10-year plague-free period (in
turn, following the 10-year burn-in period). reflecting ca. ten
plague-free years at Conata Basin following the first ferret
introductions (sylvatic plague was first detected in the Conata Basin in
May 2008; Abbott and Rocke 2012). Plague was initiated in the prairie
dog metapopulation assuming either (1) plague was initiated in a single
randomly selected prairie dog population (selected from among mid size
or larger populations in the Conata Basin), or (2) plague outbreaks
arise spontaneously with a probability of 0.005 per year per colony
(effectively resulting in spontaneous plague initiation events somewhere
in the metapopulation nearly every other year). Because RAMAS Metapop
computes the number of dispersers based on post-plague abundances, we
also computed the mean number of infected (exposed) dispersers as a
function of the final colony abundance, resulting in an estimate of 118%
(SE 28%). Therefore, we set the “probability of infection per disperser”
parameter in Ramas Metapop at its maximum value of 100% (thereby
potentially underestimating the rate of spread).</p>

<div id="dispersal" class="section level3">
<h3>Dispersal</h3>
<p>Dispersal rates (proportion of individuals dispersing between each
pair of defined populations) were modeled as a function of centre to
edge distances between populations, in order to avoid very large
populations flooding small populations around them. Dispersing prairie
dogs traveled a mean straight-line distance of 2.4 km (Garrett and
Franklin 1988). Maximum dispersal distance is 10 km (Knowles 1985 cited
in Knowles et al. 2002; Lomolino and Smith 2001). Thus, we used a
dispersal-distance function</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(a \cdot e^{\frac{-D}{b}}=0.083 \cdot
e^{\frac{-D}{2.4}}\)</span></p>
<p>where D is distance from the centre of the source population to the
closest edge of the target population, with a maximum dispersal distance
of Dmax = 10 km. We calculated the intercept (the a parameter) as
follows. Based on the spatial structure of populations, we calculated
the average number of neighbors at distances of 0-0.5 km, 0.5-1 km,
1-2.5 km, 2.5-5 km and 5-10 km. We set the intercept such that the total
expected rate of dispersal from this average population was about 0.37,
which was calculated as the product of two numbers: (1) 59% of yearling
males dispersing from a study population (based on data reported in
Tables 1 and 2 in Garrett and Franklin 1988), and (2) relative survival
rate of dispersers (calculated as 0.62, based on survival rate of 0.9
and 0.56 of residents and dispersers as reported by Garrett and Franklin
1988). For the spatial sensitivity analysis, we used a range of 0.061 to
0.105 for the a parameter, based on ± 0.10 for the total expected rate
of dispersal from the average population.</p>
<p>The above calculation refers to dispersal rate of yearling males. We
calculated the relative dispersal of other age/sex classes as 0.46 for
yearling females, 0.1 for adult males and 0.39 for adult females (based
on data reported in Tables 1 and 2 in Garrett and Franklin 1988). These
numbers are consistent with general observations of age- and
sex-specific dispersal: Hoogland (1995) reported that female prairie
dogs usually remain with their natal coterie, or they disperse long
distance to other colonies, but “short-distance dispersal of females
within the home colony almost never occurs” (p.383); male prairie dogs,
on the other hand, disperse either long-distance to new colonies (mostly
as yearlings, rarely as adults) or short-distance within the home
colony.</p>

<div id="spatial-correlation" class="section level3">
<h3>Spatial correlation</h3>
<p>Correlation of population dynamics among populations was based on a
function of center-to-center distances between populations. Because
annual fluctuations in vital rates are likely a function of weather
conditions, we used temporal correlation in weather conditions as a
proxy for describing correlation of population fluctuations.
Specifically, spatial autocorrelation in vital rates was modeled as a
function of inter-colony distances based on 30 years of summer rainfall
data from 15 sites randomly drawn from within the range of the
black-tailed prairie dog. We fitted a negative exponential model using
30 years of summer rainfall data drawn from 15 random locations in the
southwestern quarter of South Dakota (PRISM dataset; PRISM Climate
Group, Oregon State University, <a href="http://prism.oregonstate.edu"
class="uri">http://prism.oregonstate.edu</a>). The resulting equation,
correlation= exp(-D/601), where D is the distance between populations,
was used for all model runs and was not modified as part of spatial
sensitivity analyses (Fig. 5).</p>

<h3>Demographic structure and vital rates</h3>
<p>We developed an age- and sex-structured matrix model, with 5 female
and 5 male age classes. We parameterized the matrix according to a
post-breeding census, with survival rates drawn from a Wyoming mark
recapture study (Grenier 2008). Juvenile (first year) and adult
(yearling and above) survival rates were set at 0.39 (SE 0.17) and 0.67
(SE 0.15), respectively. For sensitivity analysis, we used a range of
0.22 to 0.56 for juvenile survival rate, and 0.52 to 0.82 for adult
survival rate, representing one standard error from the mean. Juvenile
and adult fecundity were set at 0.73 and 1.25, respectively, based on
observations of kits produced from 2004-2006 (Grenier 2008). For
sensitivity analysis, we used a range of 0.36 to 0.92 for juvenile
fecundity and 0.86 to 1.35 for adult fecundity.</p>
</div>
<div id="density-dependence-carrying-capacity-and-initial-abundances"
class="section level3">
<h3>Density dependence, carrying capacity, and initial abundances</h3>
<p>The strong dependence of Black-footed Ferrets on Prairie Dogs as prey
suggests density dependence based on resource limitation and linked to
resource (prey) dynamics. We therefore modeled Black-footed Ferret
density dependence with a Ricker-type density dependence, corresponding
to a scramble competition model (Brannstrom and Sumpter 2005).</p>
<p>We ran the black-footed ferret population model assuming either (1)
ferrets could only access prairie dog colonies within the Conata Basin,
or (2) ferrets could access all 1591 prairie dog colonies within the
Conata/Badlands region. In the former case, we assumed the ferrets could
only access PD colonies within the Conata Basin, a region of
approximately 13,000 ha which we delineated as the aggregate of the
three ferret subunits identified in Biggins et al. (2011). Thus,
although the PD/plague model (see above) covered a larger area of
southwestern South Dakota, only those populations in the Conata Basin
were linked to the black-footed ferret model. Because ferret populations
were rapidly extirpated by plague if limited to the Conata Basin proper,
and because the maximum possible spatial extent for black-footed ferret
populations is unclear (see main text), we also ran scenarios in which
all prairie dog populations in the Conata-Badlands region were assumed
to be available to the ferrets as prey.</p>
<p>We calculated the black-footed ferret functional response based on
the energy balance model of Stromberg et al. (1983), who concluded (via
maximum sustainable yield computations) that a habitat area capable of
supporting ca. 766 black-tailed prairie dogs was necessary to support
the minimum energy requirements of a single black-footed ferret. We
thereby equate a per-capita prey availability of 766 prairie dogs per
ferret with a stable long-term ferret population growth rate (R = 1,
corresponding to the carrying capacity in the scramble/Ricker density
dependence function in RAMAS Metapop). Thus, carrying capacity (K) of
the black-footed ferret population was calculated as 1/766 of the PD
population size in Conata Basin at each time step. However, in years of
high prairie dog abundance, ferrets typically maintain territories
supporting more prairie dogs than they need to survive (Biggins et
al. 2006b). In other words, the linear relationship between prairie dog
density and black-footed ferret carrying capacity breaks down at high
prairie dog densities. We capped the value of K at 462 for the Conata
region based on the maximum ferret density of 0.04 ferrets per ha
suggested by Biggins et al. (2006b). For global sensitivity analysis, we
similarly capped the value of K to maintain a maximum density of 0.04
ferrets per ha (therefore, K varied based on landscape extent). Thus,
even in years when prairie dog abundance is very high, the carrying
capacity of the simulated ferret population does not exceed the maximum
limit dictated by territoriality.</p>
<p>The energy balance model of Stromberg et al. (1983), upon which we
based the functional linkage between ferret carrying capacity and
prairie dog abundance (see above), assumed that ferrets fed exclusively
on prairie dogs. However, a small but non-negligible component (ca. 10%)
of the diet of the black-footed ferret is believed to comprise alternate
prey items such as mice and lagomorphs (Campbell et al. 1987). The
existence of alternate prey species raises the possibility that our
models may overestimate the per-capita prey availability necessary to
accommodate stable ferret population growth. However, prairie dogs are
consumed by many species aside from the black-footed ferret (including
badgers, bobcats, and coyotes; Hoogland 1995), raising the possibility
that our model may underestimate the number of prairie dogs necessary to
support a population of ferrets. Clearly, there is a great deal of
uncertainty around this estimate, and we are planning a follow-up study
to test the sensitivity of the ferret/prairie dog system to alternative
characterizions of the functional and numerical response. Nonetheless,
an estimated ferret carrying capacity of 485 at Conata Basin, computed
as 1/766 of estimated total prairie dog carrying capacity, is consistent
with the observed growth of the reintroduced ferret population at Conata
Basin, which was beginning to plateau at abundances ca. 350 prior to the
arrival of plague in 2007 (Livieri 2006; Fig. 6).</p>

our model.</p>
</div>
<p>We set the maximum growth rate (Rmax) to 1.48, based on the average
of two estimates of the rate of (exponential) growth in a Wyoming
population (Grenier et al. 2007). One estimate is 1.35, the eigenvalue
of the matrix fitted to mark-recapture data, and the other estimate is
1.60, the (scalar) rate of growth in the minimum number of live ferrets
from 2000 to 2006. For sensitivity analysis, we used these two
values.</p>
<p>Black-footed ferret abundance for each iteration was initialized
using known reintroduction events in the Conata Basin , as described by
Livieri (2006; i.e., dates and ages of releases were modeled explicity).
Ferret population viability was summarized using three metrics:
quasi-extinction risk (defined as the proportion of simulation runs
falling below 5 individuals at year 60 of the simulation), expected
minimum abundance (defined as the minimum abundance after year 10 of the
trajectory averaged over all 1000 simulations; McCarthy and Thompson
2001), and mean final abundance (at year 60).</p>
</div>
<div id="variability-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Variability</h3>
<p>We estimated temporal variability in ferret vital rates (i.e.,
variability not due to fluctuations in the prey base, which was modeled
explicitly via variation in K) by running the linked ferret/prairie dog
metamodel for Conata basin under plague-free conditions and adjusting
the ferret temporal variability parameter to match the observed annual
variability from the re-established ferret population in the Conata
Basin (Livieri 2006; Fig. 6). Although most of the variability in
black-footed ferret populations is likely due to variation in the prey
base (here translated into variation in K), variability in other
environmental factors may contribute to variability in black-footed
ferret vital rates. To estimate the magnitude of this contribution, we
created a retrospective model of the growth of the Conata Basin
black-footed ferret population from 1996 (shortly after its
introduction) until 2007 (before the first plague outbreak) based on
Livieri (2006). We reconstructed the Conata reintroduction effort using
RAMAS Metapop, using management events (introduction and harvest) to
schedule the history of ferret introductions and translocations
described by Livieri (2006). We ran the simulations with demographic
stochasticity, vital rates specified as above, and carrying capacity
linked to natural temporal variability in plague-free prairie dog
population density (see above). Variability in black-footed ferret
population growth in the early years of the Conata reintroduction
program was likely related to different release strategies and predator
exclusion measures (Livieri 2006). Ferret releases largely ended in
1999, and therefore we assumed that population variability observed from
2001 through 2007 (prior to sylvatic plague epizootic) were due
primarily to natural variability. Holding all other sources of
variability constant (demographic stochasticity and variability in prey
abundance), we adjusted the coefficient of variation for environmental
variation in black-footed ferret vital rates so that the median
simulated population variance (computed as the variance of (Nt+1/Nt), n
= 1000 simulations) matched the observed variability in the Conata time
series. The CV value that best fit the observed Conata time series (Fig.
6) was 11.5%, and this value was used to compute temporal process
variation for all vital rates. For sensitivity analysis, the CV for
ferret vital rates varied between 5 and 16%, which was the range of CV
values for which the observed variability fell within the interquartile
range from the simulations.</p>
