<div id="final-projects-for-nres-470" class="section level2">
<h2>Final projects for NRES 470</h2>
<p>Students will work in groups of ~3-4 people to perform a population
viability analysis (PVA) to rank conservation or management actions for
a species of conservation concern (species of your choice!). Grading
will be based on finished products (written and oral presentations) as
well as project proposals and written peer reviews.</p>
</div>
<div id="overview" class="section level2">
<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
<li>Select a species and management question of interest.</li>
<li>Perform a thorough literature review on your species of interest-
collect all the information you can about life history (e.g., age at
maturity), key vital rates (e.g., stage-structured birth and survival
rates), carrying capacity, etc.</li>
<li>Construct a population viability analysis (PVA) model, parameterized
using the best information you can find in the literature (using
InsightMaker, R, or Vortex as a modeling platform).</li>
<li>Use your PVA model to run <strong>scenario tests</strong> that
address a conservation or management question (to test your research
question)</li>
<li>Use the model results to rank conservation or management actions for
your species or population of interest</li>
<li><em>Write up the results</em> and present your results to the
class!</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="timeline-updated" class="section level2">
<h2>Timeline (updated)</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>PROPOSAL:</strong> Due Fri March 10!</li>
<li><strong>INITIAL PVA</strong> Due Wed April 12: description of how
your PVA model works and where the parameter estimates come from – and a
link to a working PVA model!<br />
</li>
<li><strong>DRAFT FINAL PAPER:</strong> Due Mon April 24.</li>
<li><strong>PEER REVIEWS:</strong> Fri Apr 28 in lab.</li>
<li><strong>FINAL PRESENTATIONS:</strong> Wed May 3 and Fri May 5!</li>
<li><strong>FINAL FINAL PAPER:</strong> Due Wed May 17</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember that the semester will get crazy at the end (including for
your instructors). Plan ahead!</p>
</div>
<div id="first-project-related-assignment-the-proposal"
class="section level2">
<h2>First project-related assignment: the proposal!</h2>
<p>Your project proposal (approx 1 pg) will consist of:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Title</strong>: should indicate what species you are
modeling, and hint at what question(s) will be addressed<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Project participants</strong>: provide names of all project
participants (3-4).<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Research question(s)</strong>: Provide one or more testable
and management-relevant questions that you plan to address using your
population model. Putting “too many” questions is okay for now- we will
talk them over in our project meetings right before spring break.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Project rationale</strong>: Describe your rationale for
choosing this species, and explain why your management/conservation
question(s) are important to address. Be as specific as possible!
Convince your instructor/TA that your project is
<strong>interesting</strong>!<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Data sources</strong>: Describe one or more information
sources you plan to use to guide PVA construction and parameterization
(convince your instructor/TA that your project is
<strong>doable</strong>!)</li>
</ol>
<p>Some key parameters you will likely need for your PVA model (and will
be searching the literature for!) are:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>survival rates</em> (usually age- or stage-structured)<br />
</li>
<li><em>birth rates</em> (usually age- or stage structured) and <em>age
at maturity</em><br />
</li>
<li><em>initial abundance</em><br />
</li>
<li><em>carrying capacity (K)</em> (potentially for several
subpopulations in a metapopulation model)<br />
</li>
<li><em>density dependence</em> (how do vital rates change as density
increases?)<br />
</li>
<li><em>stochasticity</em> (annual variability in survival and birth
rates)<br />
</li>
<li><em>dispersal rates</em> (for metapopulation models)<br />
</li>
<li><em>habitat quality</em> (for metapopulation models)<br />
</li>
<li>*response to management** (linkages between management activities
and vital rates - for running scenario tests!)</li>
</ul>
<p>We have gone over many of these concepts in class already- PVA is
just a way of putting all the concepts from this class together in a
single model! You can get the above information directly from the
published literature (or unpublished reports), or you estimate these
parameters yourself using raw data (which we haven’t yet gone over in
class- and which you are not expected to do!!). If all else fails, you
can use published records for similar species as a proxy (assuming that
the vital rates are approximately the same)!</p>
</div>
<div id="second-project-related-assignment-the-initial-pva"
class="section level2">
<h2>Second project-related assignment: the initial PVA!</h2>
<p>Your <strong>initial parameterized PVA model</strong> will consist
of:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>A ready-to-run PVA model</strong>, in whatever software
framework you are using (InsightMaker or R). This model does not need to
be your “final” model, but it should work (e.g., produce results), the
parameter estimates should be backed by some evidence or rationale (see
below), and it should be capable of running your proposed scenario
tests.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Written rationale/evidence for all of your parameter
estimates</strong> and key modeling decisions.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>For each major decision you made in constructing the model, describe
the information you used to back up your decision (and the sources of
this information). Decisions include: how many stage or age classes in
your model, what are your survival and fecundity rates (transition
rates), what is your initial abundance(s), how does population density
affect vital rates in your model (density-dependence – including Allee
effects if applicable), how much do birth and death rates vary from year
to year (environmental stochasticity), what is the impact and timing of
catastrophes (if applicable), etc. etc. Where appropriate, you can paste
figures, tables, maps, etc. drawn from your information sources- just
make sure you say where you got these images/tables etc.</li>
<li>What scenarios do you plan to test (e.g., management scenarios,
climate change, harvest, etc), and how will these scenarios help you to
address your research questions? NOTE: you don’t need to have run your
scenario tests- just state what scenario tests you propose to run!
<em>It must be clear that the working model you submitted is capable of
running all of your proposed scenario tests</em>.</li>
<li>Literature cited (format not important, as long as it includes all
key information)</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Any questions for your instructor/TA about your model that you’d
like to go over during our next project meeting (remember to sign up for
a meeting on our shared Google Sheet!).</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div
id="third-project-related-assignment-the-written-project-rough-draft-and-final-draft"
class="section level2">
<h2>Third project-related assignment: the written project (rough draft
and final draft)!</h2>
<p>Your final written paper is expected to be in the style of a
<strong>scientific manuscript</strong>. That is, it should have a
<em>title</em>, <em>introduction</em>, <em>methods</em>,
<em>results</em>, <em>discussion</em>, <em>acknowledgements</em> and
<em>literature cited</em> sections. Please also include your working PVA
model (e.g., InsightMaker link or R code).</p>
<p><strong>There are no formatting guidelines or page limits</strong>.
Please be as concise as possible while still covering all the key
elements in the grading rubric. You can use any standard format for your
references (e.g., APA), all we ask is that you be consistent!</p>
<div id="abstract" class="section level3">
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>An abstract is often the most critical part of a scientific
manuscript- because it’s often the only part that many people read! A
good abstract effectively summarizes everything in the paper- what the
study is about, why readers should care, what the research questions
are, how you answered your questions and what your key findings were,
and what the findings mean in a broader context. All in about 250 words
or less!</p>
</div>
<div id="title" class="section level3">
<h3>Title</h3>
<p>A good title should be informative, should have the species name and
should at least hint at what the research question is and its relevance
to conservation/management.</p>
</div>
<div id="introduction" class="section level3">
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This is where you introduce the topic and describe why it’s
important. You should also include your research questions here, along
with any hypotheses that you are testing (this is usually the last
paragraph of your introduction). You can recycle and flesh out the
material from your proposal! This should be at least 3 paragraphs
long.</p>
<p>Remember to cite literature here (and use a consistent format)!</p>
<p>The first paragraph(s) of the introduction should provide a clear
motivation for your research questions. Once we read your research
questions it should make total sense why you are asking these
questions!</p>
<p>The last sentences of your introduction should state your testable
research question(s).</p>
<p>Please try to cite at least 3-5 references in your introduction. For
intro and all sections: every time you cite a paper/website/report, use
the in-text citation format where you include the last name of the first
author and the year of the publication.</p>
</div>
<div id="methods" class="section level3">
<h3>Methods</h3>
<p>This is where you describe your PVA in enough detail that it
<em>could be replicated</em> by another wildlife researcher! You can
recycle much of your “initial PVA” assignment here.</p>
<p>Remember to justify all your decisions. Every parameter value you use
(survival rates, abundance, birth rate, carrying capacity, etc.) and
every factual statement you make needs to have a citation. It needs to
be clear where every single number in your model came from. You also
need to justify the time frame for your model- you should not just use a
20-year simulation time frame just because it is the default for
InsightMaker (and if you do use a 20-year time frame you need to be very
specific about why- otherwise I’ll assume you simply did not change the
default!).</p>
<p>Unlike the “Initial PVA and Methods” assignment, this time you need
to use complete sentences- no bulleted lists please! Also, try to avoid
using InsightMaker jargon (RandPoisson, stocks, flows, links, ghost
primitive, etc.). Instead, try to describe your model using “plain
English”.</p>
<p>The methods section should detail more than just how you put your
model together- it should also detail how you used the model to test
your research questions.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What different scenarios did you run?</p></li>
<li><p>How did you use the simulation results to address your
questions?</p>
<ul>
<li>How did you visualize the results?<br />
</li>
<li>Did you perform any statistical analyses?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>In general, try to avoid including figures and tables reproduced from
other studies. Just describe the key results in words and refer to the
original source. Including these figures in your paper implies you
created the figure yourself!</p>
<p>You need to define what you mean by ‘viability’, since there is no
standard definition. If you are assessing minimum viable population size
(MVP), you need to define your viability criterion- for example, ‘we
considered populations with extinction risk less than 5% over 50 years
to be viable’.</p>
<p>Try to avoid using acronyms like PVA and MVP without first defining
what stand for.</p>
<p>Most of you will use female-only models- and if so you should state
this explicitly, and describe how you accounted for this in your
fecundity estimates (e.g., you assumed a 50% sex ratio, and therefore
you multiplied the total birth rate by 50% to estimate the total number
of female offspring produced per female).</p>
<p>For both the methods and results, use the past tense- you are
describing what you did, not what you will do.</p>
<p>Please include a link to your InsightMaker model in your Methods
section (ideally, at the top of your methods section, just to make it
easier on me to find it!). If you used R, please provide your R code as
an appendix.</p>
</div>
<div id="results" class="section level3">
<h3>Results</h3>
<p>This is where you describe and present the relevant outputs from your
model. Provide figures and tables to summarize your <em>relevant</em>
results. You should include at least 2-3 figures as part of your results
section. Each figure should have an informative caption placed directly
below the figure.</p>
<p>With PVA it can be difficult to decide what to present and what not
to present. Always ask yourself: is it <em>relevant</em> to your main
questions?</p>
<p>All figures need figure numbers and captions. Figure captions can be
several sentences long and should have enough detail so that a reader
can understand the figure without referring to the main text. All figure
captions should include the name of the species being studied, should
describe what the axes represent and describe any symbols/colors that
are used. Figure captions should also describe where the data come from
(in most cases, a population simulation model!).</p>
<p>If you want to include a table from insightmaker, please import your
insightmaker table results to excel so you can format nicely (rather
than presenting a screenshot of an insightmaker table). Also try to
avoid fractional individuals in your tables</p>
<p>Don’t be constrained to insightmaker’s figures! See the <a
href="LECTURE12.html">“PVA” lecture</a> for some examples of the kinds
of figures you might make to present your results most effectively.
Don’t feel like you have to use R to make your figures- Excel is
fine!!</p>
<p>It’s okay to include one or two insightmaker figures (abundance over
time), but for most of you it will be better (more concise, more
informative) to summarize your results in a different way (like
illustrating final abundance for each scenario as a bar plot, with each
scenario presented side by side). Sometimes it helps to sketch out what
you want the figure to look like, and then work “backwards” to try and
figure out how to make that figure.</p>
</div>
<div id="discussion" class="section level3">
<h3>Discussion</h3>
<p>This is where you describe what your results really tell us with
respect to your main questions. The first paragraph in your discussion
section should summarize the key results and why they are important.
Include citations/references to other studies to indicate where your
study fits into a broader context. I expect to see at least 3-4 in-text
citations in your Discussion section.</p>
<p>Also, in your discussion you should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Describe any new questions that came up in the process of building
and running your PVA</li>
<li>Describe any potential flaws with your PVA and how you might improve
this in the future</li>
<li>Describe any future research that could be helpful in addressing
your main questions</li>
</ul>
<p>Limit your discussion of ‘flaws’ in your study to a single paragraph.
And don’t start your discussion section with the ‘flaws’ paragraph.
Start it instead with a summary of the important results and why/how
those results are important for conservation and management.</p>
<p>Let me know if you have any questions or would like to go over
anything before your final submission.</p>

<h2>Fourth project-related assignment: <strong>peer
review</strong>/feedback session</h2>
<p>In lab on Fri Apr 28 we will have a “peer review” session where we
will have a chance to give each other feedback on draft manuscripts.</p>
<p>The way it will work is as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>In the week before the peer review (probably Wednesday) you will
receive another group’s draft manuscript via WebCampus.</p></li>
<li><p>Before lab, please thoroughly read the manuscript you have been
assigned, and make comments, paying particular attention to the <a
href="WrittenProject_rubric.docx">grading rubric</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>During the lab period, you will first get together with the other
students that were also assigned to review the same manuscript. You will
have 30-35 minutes to compare notes and prepare a written peer-review of
the manuscript that highlights both the strengths and the weaknesses
that you found. Please make your comments as specific and constructive
as possible. The goal is to give your classmates feedback that will be
useful to them as they prepare their final drafts! <em>Please hand in
your peer-review to the group that wrote the draft AND your
instructor/TA</em> (submit/share via WebCampus)</p></li>
<li><p>After that, we will break up into new groups. One representative
from each peer-review group will meet with the project group that wrote
the draft manuscript, to give feedback in person.</p></li>
<li><p>For any remaining time in lab, you will have a chance to work on
your write-ups and presentations!</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Bring your laptops to lab as usual so you can write, save and share
your peer-review electronically with your classmates/instructors.</p>
<p>The peer-review session will take approximately 2 hours in total,
please plan accordingly!</p>
</div>
<div id="fifth-project-related-assignment-the-oral-presentation"
class="section level2">
<h2>Fifth project-related assignment: the oral presentation!</h2>
<p>Your group presentation should be in the style of an oral
presentation at a conference. See below for guidance on giving a good
oral presentation!</p>
<p>Presentations will take place during our final two lab periods.</p>
<p>You will have 15 minutes to give your presentations, with 2
additional minutes for questions.</p>
<p>A rubric for the presentations can be found <a
href="presentationProject_rubric.docx">here</a></p>
<p>Please plan to be in lab for the full lab period on May 5 for the
final presentations. Attendance and participation as an active audience
member (e.g., asking questions!) is an important part of this class.</p>
<div id="tips-for-a-great-presentation" class="section level3">
<h3>Tips for a great presentation!</h3>
<p>Here are some general notes about how to prepare and deliver a great
presentation:<br />
- For all slides: <em>Less words, more pictures</em>! Wordy slides often
cause people to stop paying attention! All of you are working with
charismatic species, so you shouldn’t have trouble finding nice pictures
that capture people’s attention. As for words, 3-5 bullet points
maximum! Complete sentences are NOT needed in a presentation. Use a
large, sans-serif font to improve readability.</p>
<p>Note: make sure you give proper credit for all pictures (e.g., what
website did it come from?)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Excitement is infectious- make sure you convey your excitement
about the project. You all worked very hard, and you should be proud of
what you were able to do. Now you can share this excitement with your
colleagues! Many inexperienced presenters make the mistake of
highlighting only what they were <em>not</em> able to accomplish. Try to
avoid this pitfall- shortcomings should be limited to a single slide in
the discussion section of the presentation.</p></li>
<li><p>A good presentation should <em>tell a story</em>. It has a
beginning, middle and an end. Every slide flows logically from what came
before.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep it simple- don’t use excess jargon, acronyms etc. Good
communication skills means getting your points across in the simplest
and clearest way possible.</p></li>
<li><p>Every presentation is a performance. Performance requires
practice!! The real work comes before the performance- putting together
the slides and practicing the delivery. When the time comes to actually
give the performance, relax and have fun- the hard work is
over!</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Note: please don’t use fancy backgrounds- keep your slides as clean
as possible. Animations can be useful, but excessive animation is
distracting!</p>
<div id="title-slide" class="section level4">
<h4>Title slide</h4>
<ul>
<li>Make a catchy title!</li>
<li>Include the names and affiliations of all co-authors</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="introduction-1" class="section level4">
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Tell your audience why they should care!! All of you are working
with interesting species, and all of you are asking interesting
questions. All of your audience is interested in wildlife conservation
and management. There is absolutely no reason why you shouldn’t be able
to convince your audience to care about what you have to say!!</p></li>
<li><p>Cite previous research as you set up your research question.
Convince us that your research fills a key knowledge gap. What is the
overall context of your research?</p></li>
<li><p>After you have framed the problem, <em>clearly state your
research questions</em>!</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="methods-1" class="section level4">
<h4>Methods</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Provide a <em>very abbreviated</em> summary of your PVA model.
You don’t have time to provide all the details that are in your written
Methods section! So try to distill the key elements of your methods. Be
careful you don’t spend too much time on this section! The details you
provide here must be clearly relevant to your research questions. All
you need to do is convince your peers that your methods were appropriate
for addressing your questions.</p></li>
<li><p>You can include supplemental slides that provide more details on
your methods (after the last “real” slide). It can be helpful to refer
to supplemental slides if someone asks a question about your
methods!</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="results-and-discussion" class="section level4">
<h4>Results and Discussion</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Include key figures that relate to the main questions. Only
include those figures that are the most relevant to your main research
questions- too many figures can be distracting.</p></li>
<li><p>For all plots, make sure you explain what the axes and symbols
represent! Also, make sure the axis labels are large enough to be
readable from the back of the room!</p></li>
<li><p>Summarize key findings- what did you learn? Make sure these
findings relate to the research questions stated in the introductory
slides</p></li>
<li><p>Management implications- how could wildlife managers act upon
your findings??</p></li>
<li><p><em>Just one slide</em> discussing shortcomings of your project
and how you would improve your model and design if you had additional
time.</p></li>
<li><p>Describe what you or other researchers could do to expand upon
your findings- what are the next steps?</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="acknoweldgements" class="section level4">
<h4>Acknoweldgements</h4>
<ul>
<li>Your final slide should acknowledge people who helped you with your
project but who are not listed as a co-author.</li>
</ul>
